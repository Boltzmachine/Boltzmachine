## About me
I am a third-year computer science Ph.D. student at Yale University, advised by Prof. Rex Ying. I previously obtained my B.S. degree at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Jake Zhao.
I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. The ultimate goal of his research is to transform humans - or at least himself - into AIs. This represents a pathway for humanity to transcend biological limitations (e.g. immortality) and is the only way for modern humans to evolve.

In addition to his academic pursuits, I actively contribute to several open-source projects, such as [Blender](https://projects.blender.org/Weikang-Qiu).
